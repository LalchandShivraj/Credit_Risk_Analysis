# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. So, machine learning will have to be employed to solve this challenge.
Jill requested the use of imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

### Task at hand:
Use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending service company. Oversample the data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. After also using the combinatorial approach of the SMOTEENN algorithm, compare the two machine learning models: BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk.
